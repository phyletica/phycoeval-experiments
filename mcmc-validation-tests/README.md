This directory contains some of the R scripts that are generated by the test
suite of ecoevolity. Putting some of them here to pretty-up the plots a bit.

The files

-   `5-leaf-general-tree-test.r`
-   `6-leaf-general-tree-test.r`
-   `6-leaf-NeighborHeightNodeSwapAll-test.r`
-   `6-leaf-NodeHeightSlideBumpSwapAllScaler-test.r`
-   `7-leaf-general-tree-test.r`

were output during ecoevolity's test suite. I only added some annotations to
note the testing conditions (i.e., which operators were used and how long was
the MCMC chain and how often did we sample). Also, I commented out the plotting
function, so that a prettier one defined in `plot-functions.r` will be used by
`run-tests.r` instead.

To generate the plots and run chi-square tests, simply run:

    ./run-tests.r

at the command line.
